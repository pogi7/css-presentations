# Applications

Applications will be your first connection between you and the company you want to intern at.  It's important to craft a good application since the hiring team will be reading it if they decide to interview you.

## How To Apply Efficiently?

Obviously you can go with the manual way of applying for jobs and keeping track of your applications with a spreadsheet.  (It's how I landed every job I've ever had).  There are other ways to apply automatically or simplify the process of applying to companies using AI.  (Note some of these services may require a fee or only offer limited amount of applications in a day.)

## Looking Over the Position
It's always a good idea to look over the internship position before you apply to make sure you have the technical skills to fulfill the position and if the company culture is a good fit for you.  (Don't worry if you don't feel like you fulfill all the qualifications.  It's still a good idea to apply if you feel like you can do the internship/job.)
