# Resumes

Resumes will be your foot in the door for an internship.  Hiring managers and the hiring team will sort through 100s or 1000s of resumes before getting to yours.  They will probably spend around 5 seconds looking at your resume before moving onto the next one.  You want your resume to standout.  Here's how to do it.

## What to Put in the Resume?

There are generally a few things that hiring teams are looking at when evaluating a resume.  Here is the list of what the hiring team values the most with the most important thing being at the top.  (Note this is just my hiring team.  ymmv)
- Professional Experience
- Personal Projects
- Technical Skills
- GPA
- Education/Certifications

A good example template resume can be seen [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs).

## Should I Look It Over?
Yes!  There are resources on campus such as the Career Center that can help look over your resume.  Ask your friends or mentors to help look it over as well.  It's always a good idea to look it over or have others look over your resume before you send it out. (Personally my resume has changed a lot since I was in undergrad and its constantly evolving as my career changes.)
