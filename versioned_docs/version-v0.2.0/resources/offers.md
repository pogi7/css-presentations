# Offers

Congrats on getting your internship offer.  Offers are always a very exciting time since it means you can accept or decline an invitation to intern at a company.  Here's what you can do to make the most out of your internship.

## What if you are Extended An Offer?

- Make sure everything in the offer is correct (i.e your name, address, salary, etc.)
- You don't need to negotiate your salary for an internship, but the company won't rescind your offer if you do.
- Talk with the recruiter about discord, slack, reddit, or other social media sites for interns at the company.  This will be important in making professional and personal connections.
- Get housing if you need to move.  The aforementioned social media platforms will help a lot with securing housing and roommates.  
- Ask questions during your internship.  Your internship team should be creating a safe environment for you to grow and learn during your experience.  Make the most of it by asking questions and learning from others!  
- Securing a full time/conversion offer.  This generally is dictated by budget which is out of your control, but you can always ask the question to your hiring manager on if they have the budget to convert you to full time.  If you vibe well the team your manager will try to place you in another team that has budget.

## What if You Change Your Mind?
If you already accepted the offer, but you're getting second thoughts after going on Glassdoor or talking with others what do you do?
- This is unlikely to happen, but it is generally discouraged to renege your offer.  If you do decide to do it, tell the hiring team immediately over email if you haven't started.
- You might be a put on a blacklist and recruiters may pass your name around in a negative light.  In general if you aren't applying in the same industry and don't want to stay in you should be okay.
