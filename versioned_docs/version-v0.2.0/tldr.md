# TL;DR

The Too Long; Don't Read.

## Resumes

### LaTeX

LaTeX is a programming language generally used in technical and scientific documentation.  Read more [here](https://www.latex-project.org/)

:::tip Overleaf

While not required, it is highly recommended to use LaTeX when formatting your resume.  Overleaf is a great online editor for LaTeX.  Applications written in LaTeX are easier for ATS (Application Tracking System) to automatically fill out fields such as skills or education.

## Applications

Applications can be annoying and tedious, but there are a couple of things that hiring teams are specifically looking for when filling a position such as education, experience, and relevant skills.

### Skills

:::tip Fill out Skills Section

It may be annoying to individually input each skill into this section of an application when they're already listed on your resume, but hiring teams will use this to search for candidates with skills which match their open internship position.

:::

## Interviews

Normally hiring teams will go through multiple interviews before extending an offer to a candidate.  You want to stand out in a positive and memorable way.

### Ask Questions

:::danger Hiring Teams Want You To Ask Questions
It is very important to ask questions when the hiring team asks if you have any questions.  Not asking a question may communicate to the hiring team that you're disinterested in the position and you are less likely to be extended an offer.

## Recruitment Process

While every industry, company, and team are different, here what is what most companies use.

### Applicant Tracking System
An [ATS](https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/recruiting/what-is-applicant-tracking-system/) allows companies to track candidates across the recruitment lifecycle so basically from first application to final offer.

### What Stands Out?
This depends on the values your team, company, and most importantly your future boss have.  For someone still in school, GPA, club engagement, group projects, and prior internship experience are what stand out to a hiring team.
