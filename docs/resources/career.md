# Career

This is my personal career from when I started college (Aug 2017) to the present.

## Education
If I could go back and change anything, I wouldn't.  I was personally very happy with my educational career and felt that I learned a lot in the 8 years that I put into my schooling.  I probably won't be doing a Ph.D or MBA though.

### Georgia Tech (Jan 2023 - Jul 2025)
- MS in Computer Science  
- JPL paid for my entire education at Georgia Tech.  
- Balancing FT work and PT school was challenging as I was at a point in my life where school wasn't a necessity for my job.  
    - When I started my master's, I knew that 2 years or however long it would take me to earn my degree would pass.  I wanted to have my master's when the time passed.

### Cal Poly Pomona (Aug 2019 - Dec 2021)
- BS in Electrical Engineering  
- Most of my time at CPP was during Covid so I didn't get a chance to have an on campus experience, but I still talk with one of my good friends in my graduating class.  
- I felt I would always be in electrical engineering, but work sometimes changes what I felt. 
    - Be open to new opportunities.  
    - In school I hated programming and thought I would never do it after I graduated.  It's my career now and I can't see myself doing anything else.

### Citrus College (Aug 2017 - Aug 2019)
- AS in Mathematics
- I was very happy to start my educational career at a community college.  
- I made a lot of changes in my major while attending such as going from being a mechanic to a mechanical engineer to a electrical engineer.  
    - There were a lot of non-traditional students when I attended who made career changes later on in their lives.

## Experience

### JPL (Aug 2022 - present)
- Working for NASA and JPL has always been a dream of mine and I feel very satisfied that I am able to live that dream.  
- JPL does not pay the same amount compared to FAANGs or other tech companies, but the work I do gives me the income to do the things I want in my life while also giving me the work life balance to not be burnt out.  
- I personally think it's really cool to know my code is orbiting Jupiter or on Mars.
- Historically, government work is more stable than private sector, but currently that is not the case.  
    - Government work never gives stock options or [RSUs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp) that a private or publicly traded company offers.

### Lockheed Martin (Jun 2020 - Jul 2022)
- I moved from SoCal to Denver to pursue this opportunity.
- My first internship was fully remote due to the pandemic, but the second internship was not.
- My internship was converted into a FT offer.  
- I was able to understand what I valued out of work and what jobs wouldn't be the best fit for me.  I found that defense is not something I would work for again.
    - The people and code I got to write were really cool though.  I just didn't like how my work was being used for.
