# Industries

These are the industries I've personally worked in and my opinions on them.

## Aerospace / Defense
The aerospace / defense industry is a pretty large industry where a lot of interns and new grads go.  They offer a lot of coding and engineering positions. 

### Work Life Balance
- Most engineers including software engineers or SWEs, work on a product or project that the company sells such as a spacecraft or a missile. These projects are broken up into phases going from Phase A to Phase F.
    - Phase A is extremely laid back while things get increasingly more stressful as you get closer to launch in Phase E.  Phase F is when the project ends which might be decades after launch.  [Project Lifecycles](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/3-0-nasa-program-project-life-cycle/) 
- Most employees only work 40 hrs a week, but can work more.  Salary and hourly workers can earn OT depending on the project and company policy.
    - Exceptions are startups like [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/) 

### Pay
- Pay is generally below other industies, but check [reputable salary reporting websites](https://www.levels.fyi/) to understand where your offer stands within the market.
    - Exceptions are startups like [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/)
- Raises are generally restricted by company policy.  Most people know that the best way to get a raise is to job hop.  
    - About 2 - 3 years is the right amount of time to stay at a position, before considering a move (unless the job isn't the right fit).

### Job Security
- If you have a security clearance your job security is incredibly high as clearances are extremely in demand.  Most clearances take around 6 months to a year to be granted to an applicant.  [Security Clearances](https://www.clearancejobs.com/security-clearance-faqs) 
    - The government will have access to a lot of personal information and significant events in your life like a marriage or high debt must be reported. 
- Historically, these jobs are stable even w/o a clearance since the large earning contracts are given by the US federal government.  The Trump administration is changing the stability of that.
